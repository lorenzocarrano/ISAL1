\chapter{Control Unit}
\label{cha3}
The control unit is the entity that regulates the functions of the pipeline. It receives as input the OPCODE, as well as the FUNC3 and FUNC7 when present. 
According to those values it generates the correct control signals for the components present in the datapath. The signals are then pipelined in order to 
arrive to the corresponding component exactly when they are needed. Specifically the OPCODE specifies what kind of instruction has to be executed, while the
FUNC codes are used to control the operation performed by the ALU.
