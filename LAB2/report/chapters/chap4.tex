In general, it can be noticed that the best performance is obtained by means of optimization using registers.
Compiling with compile ultra command returns a solution that is a good compromise between performance and total area.
For example, compiling the base architecture using compile ultra, it can be achieved a performance growth of 14\% at the cost of 9\% of additional area, while
modifying the base architecture inserting registers, a growth of 73\% of performance is achieved, at the cost of about 13\% of additional area.
Thus, in general, if  the area constraints are not so critical, optimizing by means of registers can be strongly efficient in terms of performance.
